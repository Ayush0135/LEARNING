ðŸ§ Machine Learning Journey ðŸš€
This repository is a collection of my step-by-step learning, projects, and experiments in the field of Machine Learning. It includes hands-on practice with core ML concepts, model building, data preprocessing, evaluation techniques, and real-world use cases.

Iâ€™ll be continuously updating this repo as I learn and implement more.

ðŸ§° Tools & Libraries
Python, NumPy, Pandas

Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Scikit-learn

Jupyter Notebook

Flask for app deployment

ðŸ“Œ Note
This is a work-in-progress repository. Iâ€™ll keep updating it as I grow through my ML learning path. Feel free to fork or follow along!
