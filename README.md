📚 Machine Learning Learning Roadmap

Welcome to my Machine Learning Journey!
This roadmap is not just a checklist but a study guide — with explanations for each step, covering both theory and practice.

🏁 Introduction to Machine Learning

What is Machine Learning (ML)?
Understanding how ML allows systems to learn from data and improve performance without explicit programming.

Complete Roadmap to Learn ML :

A structured plan to cover data preprocessing, algorithms, evaluation, and deployment.

📌 Data Understanding & Preprocessing
Types of Variables in ML
Learn about categorical, numerical, and ordinal variables and their importance in feature engineering.

Data Cleaning in ML
Process of fixing or removing incorrect, incomplete, or irrelevant data to ensure accuracy.

Handling Missing Values

Dropping Missing Values: Removing records with missing data when safe to do so.

Imputing Categorical Data: Replacing missing categories with mode, “Unknown,” or predictive methods.

Scikit-Learn Imputation: Automating imputation using built-in ML tools.

Encoding Techniques

One-Hot Encoding & Dummy Variables: Converting categorical variables into binary columns.

Label Encoding: Assigning numeric values to categorical labels.

Ordinal Encoding: Encoding variables that have a natural order (e.g., low, medium, high).

Handling Outliers

IQR Method: Detecting outliers by measuring spread using quartiles.

Z-Score Method: Identifying extreme values based on standard deviations from the mean.

Feature Scaling

Standardization: Rescaling data to have mean 0 and variance 1.

Normalization: Scaling data between 0 and 1 for uniform comparison.

Handling Duplicate Data
Removing duplicate records to avoid bias in training.

Replacing & Changing Data Types
Ensuring variables are in correct formats (int, float, category) for analysis.

Function Transformer
Using transformations (like log, square root) to improve data distribution.

Feature Selection

Backward Elimination: Removing less significant features step by step.

Forward Elimination: Adding features gradually to find the best subset.

Train-Test Split
Splitting data into training and testing sets to evaluate generalization.

📌 Regression Analysis
Regression Fundamentals
Predicting continuous values (like prices or scores) based on input features.

Linear Regression

Simple Linear Regression: Predicting using a single independent variable.

Multiple Linear Regression: Using multiple features to predict outcomes.

Polynomial Regression: Capturing non-linear relationships with polynomial terms.

Cost Functions

Understanding Cost Functions: Quantifying prediction errors.

R² & Adjusted R²: Measuring how well the model explains variance.

Best Fit Line
Finding the regression line that minimizes errors between predictions and actual values.

Regularization Techniques

L1 (Lasso): Shrinks less important feature coefficients to zero.

L2 (Ridge): Penalizes large coefficients to prevent overfitting.

📌 Classification Techniques
Introduction to Classification
Predicting discrete labels (e.g., spam vs. not spam, disease vs. no disease).

Logistic Regression

Binary Classification: Predicting between two classes.

Multiple Inputs: Handling multiple predictors for classification.

Polynomial Logistic Regression: Capturing non-linear boundaries.

Multiclass Classification: Extending logistic regression to more than two classes.

Confusion Matrix
Evaluating classification models with true positives, false positives, etc.

Evaluation Metrics

Precision, Recall, Sensitivity, F1 Score: Metrics for balanced model performance.

Imbalanced Datasets
Handling skewed data distributions using resampling, SMOTE, or class weights.

Naive Bayes Classifier
A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem, simple yet effective for text and categorical data.

📌 Next Steps (Coming Soon)
Decision Trees & Random Forests: Tree-based models for classification & regression.

Support Vector Machines (SVM): Powerful algorithm for linear & non-linear classification.

K-Nearest Neighbors (kNN): Instance-based learning using similarity.

Ensemble & Boosting Methods: Combining models for better accuracy (Bagging, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost).

Dimensionality Reduction: Simplifying data with PCA while retaining key patterns.

Model Deployment with Flask: Serving trained ML models as web applications.
